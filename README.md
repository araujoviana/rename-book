# rename-book

Command-line tool written in Rust that renames PDF and EPUB files to kebab-case.

It takes a single file path as an argument.

## Why

Because I needed a quick way to organize my documents and books üê±.

## Usage

```bash
rename-book <file-path>
```

- `<file-path>`:  The path to the PDF or EPUB file you want to rename.

This tool performs multiple checks to verify and process files, specifically PDFs and EPUBs, renaming them with kebab-case stems while preserving the file extension.
